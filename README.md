A simple to-do app built with React, TypeScript, and Vite using JSON Server as a mock backend.

- Persist data with JSON Server

## Installation
Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManushStepanyan/Todo_List.git
   cd Todo_List

## Run Locally
To run the app locally you need to have json server and app running parrarely.
for app use ``npm run dev`` command
for json-server ``npm run json-server`` command

``Typescript`` to ensure types are correct
